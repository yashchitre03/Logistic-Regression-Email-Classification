# Logistic Regression E-mail Classification
​	The python program implements logistic regression for e-mail classification. This is part of a supervised learning problem. The input files are in the csv format. The last column denotes the class label of the data set. Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occurring in the e-mail.



## Requirement

* Python 3
* [spambasetrain.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)
* [spambasetest.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)



## Prerequisites

* [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

* [Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)

  


## Running the tests

​	It contains two different programs for different lambda values. The  program will parse the input csv file.

The program will output the following :

* Accuracy
  * Testing Accuracy
  * Training Accuracy
* Changes to accuracy for different number of iterations.
